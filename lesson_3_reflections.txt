Reflection 1: Remote repository
  * Remote is similar to local branches except they are stored on cloud. You can create a repository on githubt, then copy the URL
  * On the local dir (that may or may not has a local .git), run:
      -git remote add [branch name (first one should be origin by convention)] [URL] 
        #creates remote branch in that remote repository linked via URL
      -git push origin master 
        #push the local master branch to origin (remote branch)
      -git remote to show all remote branches (-v to show both push and pull url).
